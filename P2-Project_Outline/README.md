## Submission Instructions

### Overview

My project wil be called Book Logger which will allow readers to track what books they have read and want to read in the future. Users can create an account, log in, add desired books to their wish list and books they have already read to their reading log. Within the reading log, they will be able to rate the books they have already read for future references.

I chose to do this project because my daughter who is in high school has a lot of books she has to work with but is always finding a way to organize them into categories like which ones she has finished, not finished, which ones are good and which ones are not that good. I want to help her by creating a way in which she can organize her books and can also rate them. This application is the right option for readers who are having trouble keeping track of their books and reading journey.

### Features

* User Account: Users will be able to create a new account for themselves, allowing them to track their books based on their own interest.
* User Login: Users will be able to login after creating an account. Passwords will be hashed.
* Add: Users will be able to add new books into their wish list. 
* Edit: Users will be able to edit their existing books.
* Delete: Users will be able to delete the books from their list.
* Rate: Users will be able to rate the books after they are done reading them.

### Technologies

* Java
* Springboot
* JavaScript
* Thymeleaf templates
* MySQL

### What I'll Have to Learn

I am new in this field so I will have to do further research in these technology so I can connect it to the features of my project. I will need to learn the basics of JavaScript and possibly more. Since this is something I would like to do more, this project would be a great way to force me to do so. I am sure there are other things that I will need to learn, such as hashing passwords which I have not done with Java yet.
